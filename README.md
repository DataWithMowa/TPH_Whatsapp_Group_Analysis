## Introduction: 
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  <br>
  
The TPH WhatsApp Group is the main online space for members of The Publishers House (TPH) ‚Äî a church based at The House of Bread, Korinjoh House, Opposite Shawarma and Grills, British, Jos, Nigeria.

The group is used for:
- Sharing church updates and announcements
- Talking and staying connected with other members, leaders, and workers
- Celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, and other special moments

This project is a data analysis of the group. It looks at things like how often people chat, the most active times, what kind of messages are shared, and how people interact in the group. The goal is to better understand how the group works and how it can serve the church even more.

## Project Objective:

 <br>
  
The goal of this project is to provide answers to the following questions:

- Who celebrates birthdays the most üéâ
- The most common words we use
- The emotional tone of our conversations
- Peak hours and days of message activity
- Who sends the most messages and gets the most responses
- How quickly we respond
- Who consistently engages the most
- And how many of our 274 members are active participants

It‚Äôs a look into what our group chats reveal about us as a spiritual family.

## Setup and Execution Instructions

### How the Data Was Collected

The dataset used for this project was exported from our church‚Äôs WhatsApp group using the **‚ÄúExport Chat‚Äù** feature.

* WhatsApp generated a `.zip` file, which I downloaded.
* After extracting (unzipping) the file, I got a `.txt` file containing all the messages.
* This `.txt` file became the raw data used for analysis.

---

### Data and Configuration

You can find all the data files used in this project in the `Datasets/` directory of this repository. This folder contains:

* **TPH Data Zip File**: The raw WhatsApp export file from our church group, downloaded directly using WhatsApp's "Export Chat" feature.
* **Text File**: The `.txt` file extracted from the ZIP, which contains the raw message data. You can find it inside the Zip file folder
* **church_chat**: A processed version of the `.txt` file, converted to a structured `.csv` format using Python in Google Colab.
* **church_chat_clean**: A final, cleaned version of the data used for exploration and analysis.

These files make it easy to follow the full data journey ‚Äî from raw export to structured insights.

---

### Environment Used

I didn‚Äôt run this project locally on my system. Instead:

* I used **Google Colab Notebooks** to write and run all the Python code.
* I **connected my Google Drive** to Colab so I could store files in the cloud, access the `.txt` file, and save the resulting `.csv` file.

---

### Tools & Python Libraries Used

This project was done entirely on **Google Colab**, so there was no need to install anything manually. However, here are the key tools and Python libraries used throughout the analysis:

* **Python:** The main programming language used for all tasks.
* **Pandas:** For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** Used to create basic visualizations.
* **WordCloud:** To visualize frequently used words in the chat data.
* **Emoji:** For identifying and analyzing emojis used in messages.
* **re (Regular Expressions):** For text parsing and message formatting.
* **datetime:** For processing and analyzing timestamps.

All these libraries were either pre-installed in Colab or installed using simple pip commands like:

```python
!pip install wordcloud emoji
```

You don‚Äôt need to install these manually if you open the notebooks via Colab, they will run smoothly

---

### Project Workflow Overview

1. **Step 1 ‚Äì Data Export:**
   I wrote a Colab Notebook that reads the `.txt` file (from the exported WhatsApp chat) and converts it to a well-structured `.csv` file.

2. **Step 2 ‚Äì Data Analysis (EDA):**
   I created another Colab Notebook where I explored the data using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to extract insights.

---

### No Local Setup Required

Since this project was fully executed on Google Colab, you don‚Äôt need to install Python, Jupyter, or VS Code to run it.

## Recommendations & Conclusions:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 <br>  

This is not a business report, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not making any formal suggestions or including a ‚ÄúRecommendations‚Äù section. However, we can consider doing the following:

1. Make use of Best Times to Post
Schedule important announcements or discussions between 8‚Äì11 AM or 8‚Äì10 PM, especially midweek.
Avoid Mondays for heavy posts since it‚Äôs the quietest.

2. Encourage Fast, Responsive Culture
The median reply time is 0 mins. Excellent!
Let‚Äôs preserve this by discouraging ghosting and thanking people for responding quickly.

Overall, this analysis provided a clear view of how the TPH WhatsApp group engages over time. From top contributors to peak activity periods, the data reflects the life and rhythm of our community.

It‚Äôs a beautiful reminder that what goes on, on the group matters.
